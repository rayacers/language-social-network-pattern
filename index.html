          <h3 class="section-subheading">Introduction</h3>
          
          <p>A common stereotype is that western people are more active on social media than 
           eastern people, but how much truth there is in this sentence? Let's check. 
            
	    We propose to analyze the featuresâ€™ distribution of different language users. Starting from common
	    insights, that already available to everyone on the platform, like number of followers or total number of tweets
            we created new features, like daily mean number of tweetss and an internationality coefficient to say samething more with 
		 respect to the superficial differences. So we cluster the languages in two groups: Western and Eastern and we focused on their comparison.
		  We take advangage of the study of paper [ADD A LINK] and  In order to do so, we reproduce two 
          	  propositions, 80-20 law, and cycardian law. Besides, we check the following preference of 
          	  different language users. In the end, we apply machine learning algorithm both in a supervised and a unsupervised way to see if 
		  these differnce of behaviour are so marked that we can predict the 
         	   culture of a user only based on the features of his/her own Twitter profile.</p>
          
          
          <h3 class="section-subheading">Datasets</h3>

          <p><b>EgoAlterProfiles</b>: EgoAlterProfiles dataset contains profiles of two kind of users. One is ego which is uniformly
             sampled from Twitter API, and the other one is alter which is the follower or the followee of
              the ego. There are 34,006 egos and over 2,000,000 alters in this dataset. The profiles include 
              followers counts, friends counts, statuses counts, and using languages of egos and alters.</p>

          <p><b>EgoNetwork</b>: EgoNetwork dataset contains the following relationship between egos and alters. There are over
             4,000,000 following relationship in this dataset.</p>
          
          <p>Note that the dataset only contains ego-alter following relationship but not ego-ego and
             alter-alter following relationship</p>

          <p><b>EgoTimelines</b>: EgoTimelines dataset contains information of tweets that generated by egos during a certain
             period. The information of tweets include create time, hashtag usage, mentioned ID etc.</p>
          

          
          <h3 class="section-subheading">Research Questioin</h3>

          <p>Do different language users have different characteristic on 
            statistical results? ( i.e. activeness, popularity etc.)</p>
          
          <p>Do different culture (western and eastern) users have different 
            using behaviors on Twitter?</p>
          
          <p>Can we predict the culture of a user based on the features of 
            his/her own Twitter profile and that of the follower-followee network?</p>

        <h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Activeness Analysis</h2>
        <h3 class="section-subheading">An overview of the dataset</h3>

        <p>Before the story start, we need to take a look on the language composition of the dataset. 
          Since alters in this dataset is not randomly sampled, so we only consider egos in this section. 
          After filtering out some inactive users who do not post and do not have followers, we get the 
          language composition of the data.</p>
        
        <div class="box">
          <button class="btn btn-primary js-scroll-trigger" onclick="getElementById('figure_1').src='static/img/community_size_all.jpg'">All Languages</button>
          <button class="btn btn-primary js-scroll-trigger" onclick="getElementById('figure_1').src='static/img/community_size_west.jpg'">Western Languages</button>
          <button class="btn btn-primary js-scroll-trigger" onclick="getElementById('figure_1').src='static/img/community_size_east.jpg'">Eastern Languages</button>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
          <img src='static/img/community_size_all.jpg' width="100%" height="auto" id="figure_1">
        </div>

        <p>There are 7 western languages and 5 eastern languages in our refined dataset, and have 10,428 
          and 2,297 users respectively. From the figures, we learn that there is a very high majority of 
          English users, and top 3 languages, English, Japanese, and Spanish constitute almost 75% of the 
          total users. Furthermore, among eastern languages, Japanese users are the majority.</p>

        <h3 class="section-subheading">Who is more popular?</h3>

        <p>To address this problem we first explain the meaning of friends. Friends are the people that 
          mentioned by the user above two times. The box-plots below show the number of the followers 
          and the friends among different languages, and the barplots show the mean value of followers 
          and friends among different languages.</p>

        <div class="box">
          <button class="btn btn-primary js-scroll-trigger" onclick="getElementById('figure_2').src='static/img/popularity_statistics_boxplot.jpg'">Boxplot</button>

        <div class="box">
          <img src='static/img/popularity_statistics_boxplot.jpg' width="100%" height="auto" id="figure_2">
        </div>

        <p>From the figures, we can have some statistical results:</p>

        <p>1. The maximum average number of followers belong to Arabic.</p>
        <p>2. The minimum average number of followers belong to Korean.</p>
        <p>3. The maximum average number of friends belong to Arabic.</p>
        <p>4. The minimum average number of friends belong to Korean.</p>

        <p>Switching to a cultural perspective, do western culture really have higher popularity than eastern 
          culture on Twitter? To address this problem, we than group the data by culture according to the 
          languages.</p>

        <div class="box">
          <img src='static/img/culture_popularity_boxplot.jpg' width="100%" height="auto">
        </div>

        <p>Surprisingly, the results show that eastern culture has more followers than western culture, 
          while two cultures have similar number of friends.</p>

        <h3 class="section-subheading">Who is more active?</h3>

        <p>
          First, We define the activeness as two values, total tweets counts and daily tweet counts. The 
          box-plots below show the number of total tweets and daily tweets among different languages, and 
          the barplots show the mean value of total tweets and daily tweets among different languages.
        </p>

        <div class="box">
          <button class="btn btn-primary js-scroll-trigger" onclick="getElementById('figure_3').src='static/img/activeness_statistics_boxplot.jpg'">Boxplot</button>
          <button class="btn btn-primary js-scroll-trigger" onclick="getElementById('figure_3').src='static/img/activeness_statistics_barplot.jpg'">Barplot</button>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
          <img src='static/img/activeness_statistics_boxplot.jpg' width="100%" height="auto" id="figure_3">
        </div>

        <p>From the figures, we can have some statistical results:</p>
        
        <p>1. The maximum average number of statuses belong to Japanese.</p>
        <p>2. The minimum average number of statuses belong to Germany</p>
        <p>3. The maximum average number of daily tweets belong Japanese.</p>
        <p>4. The minimum average number of daily tweets belong to Germany</p>

        <p>We also analyze it from a cultural perspective:</p>

        <div class="box">
          <img src='static/img/culture_activeness_boxplot.jpg' width="100%" height="auto">
        </div>

        <p>Same as the popularity, eastern culture surprisingly have higher activeness on Twitter.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Using behavior Analysis</h2>

          <p>In this section, we would like to know if eastern culture and western culture have different 
            community using behavior on Twitter. In order to solve this problems, we then focus on three 
            seperate questions.</p>

          <h3 class="section-subheading">Do both western and eastern culture follow 80-20 rules?</h3>

          <p>The 80-20 rule originally referred to the observation that 80% of Italyâ€™s wealth belonged to only 
            20% of the population. From the replication we did before, we have already known that users on Twitter 
            follow the 80-20 rule. In this analysis, we seperate users into western and eastern groups and see 
            whether both two groups still follow 80-20 rule or a power law distribution in general.</p>
          
          <div class="box">
            <img src='static/img/tweets_per_user_distribution.jpg' width="100%" height="auto" id="figure_4">
          </div>

          <p>Parameter N means that only the users who have posted more than N tweets are included. The selection 
            of N does not influence the distribution qualitatively. The distribution of number of tweets per user 
            is quite similar for both. And the law of 80-20% is still plausible. </p>

          <h3 class="section-subheading">Do western and eastern culture follow cycardian pattern on twitter?</h3>
          
          <div class="box">
            <img src='static/img/active_time.jpg' width="100%" height="auto" id="figure_4">
          </div>

          <p>The plot for the eastern and western cultures look quite different. But they still seem to follow the 
            circadian rythm pattern as suggested in the paper.</p>
          <p>But an interesting thing to note is that a peak in the number of tweets is visible around 22h for both 
            west and east, but there is an equally high peak in the number of tweets around 13h in the east. Also, 
            the number of active users gradually increase after 4h for both west and east. But there is a drastic 
            dip in the number of active users between 15h and 21h in the east.</p>
          <p>Moreover, western users have a lower activity on weekend, while eastern users do not have this characteristic.</p>
          
          <h3 class="section-subheading">Do users in different languages have specific following preference?</h3>

          <p> In this section, we would like to know if users in different languages have specific following preference. 
            Therefore we sum up the following relationship between users in different languages, and we could know the 
            following pattern of different language users. Here we only consider the following pairs which egos are the 
            followers.</p>

          </div>
        
          <p>From the figures, we learn that people always like to follow accounts that use same language with 
            themselves. It is obvious. However, we also find other interest facts:</p>
          
          <p>- All users in different languages have a high tendency to follow English accounts.</p>
          
          <p>- Western languages users have higher interest to English accounts that eastern languages users.</p>
          
          <p>- People speak Portuguese and people speak Spanish have higher rate to follow each other comparing 
            to other languages.</p>
          
          <p>Besides, we introduce another feature, internationality. Internationality value is computed for each 
            ego and it is equal to number of followers with an other language over the total number of followers.</p>

          <div class="box">
            <img src='static/img/internationality.jpg' width="100%" height="auto" id="figure_5">
          </div>

          <p>From the figure, we could learn that people speak Gernamy have the largest internationality which means 
            they have high interest to follow different languages accounts. On the other hand, people speak Japanese 
            have the lowest internationality, which means they are less likely to follow different languages accounts.

        <h3 class="section-subheading">Do different language users have different characteristic on 
          statistical results? ( i.e. activeness, popularity etc.)</h3>
        
        <p>From our results, we can clearly see that eastern culture have higher activeness and
          popularity on Twitter. Among all languages, people speak Arabic have most friends and 
          most followers, while people speak Korean have least friends and followers. Besides, 
          people speak Japanese have highest average daily tweets, while people speak Germany
          have lowest average daily tweets. To sum up, Arabic culture is most popular, while Korean 
          culture is least popular. Also, Japanese is most active, while Germany is least 
          active.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section-subheading">Do different culture (western and eastern) users have different 
          using behaviors on Twitter?</h3>
        
        <p><b>80-20 law</b>: Both eastern and western culture follows 80-20 law</p>
        
        <p><b>Cycardian law</b>: Both eastern and western culture follows cycardian law. However, 
          eastern users are more active at lunch and and late night, while western users like to 
          post tweet at around 8 p.m.

        <p><b>Following Preference</b>: People always like to follow accounts that use same language 
          with themselves. Moreover, All users in different languages have a high tendency to follow 
          English accounts.</p>

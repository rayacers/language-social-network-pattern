          <h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Overview</h2>
          
          <h3 class="section-subheading">Introduction</h3>
          
          <p> There is a common stereotype that western people are more active on social media than eastern people.
		  But how true is this statement? Let's find out! </p>
		  
	  <p> We propose to analyze the features' distribution of different language users to find any interesting patterns.
		  Starting from the insights that are already available to everyone on the Twitter platform (number of followers 
		  or number of tweets), we generated additional features such as average daily number of tweets and an internationality 
		  coefficient to say something more with respect to the superficial differences between different cultures. 
		  Further, we categorize the users based upon their language into two broad groups - Western and Eastern. The data analysis 
		  is mostly based on comparing and describing the notable differences between these groups.
		  
		  We also try to confirm the behavior analysis provided in our reference paper 
		  [ADD LINK: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134270] and we replicate two propositions, 
		  namely the 80-20 Rule and the Circadian Rhythms, but this time, we consider only one category (Western vs Eastern) at a time. 
		  We also check the preference in following other users among users of different languages.
		  
		  Finally, we apply machine learning algorithms, both in a supervised and unsupervised framework, to see if the difference in 
		  behaviour of different language users are distinct enough to predict a user's culture (Western or Eastern) based on the features 
		  of the user's Twitter profile alone. </p>
          
          
          <h3 class="section-subheading">Datasets Used</h3>

          <p><b>EgoAlterProfiles</b>: This dataset contains profiles of two kinds of users - egos and alters.
		The ego users are uniformly sampled from Twitter API, and the alter users are derived by adding the 
		the follower or the followee of the ego users. There are 34,006 egos and over 2,000,000 alters in this dataset. 
		It includes Twitter profile data for each user, egos and alters, which includes the followers counts, friends counts, 
		statuses counts, and language used by the user.</p>

          <p><b>EgoNetwork</b>: This dataset contains the 'following' relationship on Twitter between the egos and alters. 
		There are over 4,000,000 following networks in this dataset.</p>
          
          <p>Note that the dataset only contains ego-alter following relationship but not ego-ego and
             alter-alter following relationship</p>

          <p><b>EgoTimelines</b>: This dataset contains information of tweets generated by the egos during a certain
             period. The information of tweets include create time, hashtag usage, mentioned ID etc.</p>
          

          
          <h3 class="section-subheading">Research Questions</h3>

          <p>1. Do different language users have different characteristic on 
            statistical results? ( i.e. activeness, popularity etc.)</p>
          
          <p>2. Do different culture (western and eastern) users have different 
            behaviors on Twitter?</p>
          
          <p>Can we predict the culture (western or eastern) of a user based on the features of 
            the user's Twitter profile and that of the follower-followee network?</p>
            

          <h3 class="section-subheading">Language Code Table</h3>
		
	<p> The following table presents the mapping between the language code and the language of the user. It is a useful reference
		when comparing data from the various plots in further sections. </p>
		
	<p> Please note that this is not the complete list of languages used by the users in the original dataset, but only 
		a subset of languages relevant to the dataset used for our plots. </p>

        <h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Features Analysis</h2>
        <h3 class="section-subheading">An overview of the dataset</h3>

        <p>Before we start our data story, we need to take a look at the language composition of the dataset. 
          Since alters in this dataset are not randomly sampled, we only consider egos in this section.
	  We also filter out some inactive users who haven't posted any tweets or do not have followers
	  in order to get the language composition of the data.</p>
        
        <div class="box">
          <button class="btn btn-primary js-scroll-trigger" onclick="getElementById('figure_1').src='static/img/community_size_all.jpg'">All Languages</button>
          <button class="btn btn-primary js-scroll-trigger" onclick="getElementById('figure_1').src='static/img/community_size_west.jpg'">Western Languages</button>
          <button class="btn btn-primary js-scroll-trigger" onclick="getElementById('figure_1').src='static/img/community_size_east.jpg'">Eastern Languages</button>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
          <img src='static/img/community_size_all.jpg' width="100%" height="auto" id="figure_1">
        </div>

        <p>There are 7 western languages and 5 eastern languages in our refined dataset, which have 10,428 
          and 2,297 users respectively. From the figures, we learn that there is a very high majority of 
          English users, and the top 3 languages (English, Japanese, and Spanish) constitute almost 75% of the 
          total users. Furthermore, among eastern languages, Japanese users form the majority.</p>

        <h3 class="section-subheading">Who is more popular?</h3>

        <p>To address this problem, we must first understand the definition of 'friends' in our dataset. 
	  Friends are an ego's followers that have been mentioned by the ego at least twice. 
	  The box-plots below show the number of the followers and the friends among different languages, 
          and the barplots show the mean value of followers and friends among different languages.</p>

        <div class="box">
          <button class="btn btn-primary js-scroll-trigger" onclick="getElementById('figure_2').src='static/img/popularity_statistics_boxplot.jpg'">Boxplot</button>
          <button class="btn btn-primary js-scroll-trigger" onclick="getElementById('figure_2').src='static/img/popularity_statistics_barplot.jpg'">Barplot</button>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
          <img src='static/img/popularity_statistics_boxplot.jpg' width="100%" height="auto" id="figure_2">
        </div>

        <p>From the plots, the following statistical results are clearly observable:</p>

        <p>1. The maximum average number of followers belong to Arabic.</p>
        <p>2. The minimum average number of followers belong to Korean.</p>
        <p>3. The maximum average number of friends belong to Arabic.</p>
        <p>4. The minimum average number of friends belong to Korean.</p>

        <p>Switching to a cultural perspective, do the users from the western culture really have higher popularity than 
	  users from eastern culture on Twitter? To answer this question, we group the data by culture according to the 
          languages spoken in both regions.</p>

        <div class="box">
          <img src='static/img/culture_popularity_boxplot.jpg' width="100%" height="auto">
        </div>

        <p>Surprisingly, the results show that eastern culture users have more followers than western culture users, 
          while both the cultures have similar number of friends.</p>

        <h3 class="section-subheading">Who is more active?</h3>

        <p>
          First, We define the activeness using two features - total tweets counts and average daily tweet counts. The 
          box-plots below show the number of total tweets and daily tweets among different languages, and 
          the barplots show the mean value of total tweets and daily tweets among different languages.
        </p>

        <div class="box">
          <button class="btn btn-primary js-scroll-trigger" onclick="getElementById('figure_3').src='static/img/activeness_statistics_boxplot.jpg'">Boxplot</button>
          <button class="btn btn-primary js-scroll-trigger" onclick="getElementById('figure_3').src='static/img/activeness_statistics_barplot.jpg'">Barplot</button>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
          <img src='static/img/activeness_statistics_boxplot.jpg' width="100%" height="auto" id="figure_3">
        </div>

        <p>From the plots, the following statistical results are clearly observable:</p>
        
        <p>1. The maximum average number of statuses belong to Japanese.</p>
        <p>2. The minimum average number of statuses belong to Germany</p>
        <p>3. The maximum average number of daily tweets belong Japanese.</p>
        <p>4. The minimum average number of daily tweets belong to Germany</p>

        <p>We also analyze it from a cultural perspective:</p>

        <div class="box">
          <img src='static/img/culture_activeness_boxplot.jpg' width="100%" height="auto">
        </div>

        <p>Surprisingly again, eastern culture users have higher activeness than the western culture users on Twitter.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
          <h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Using behavior Analysis</h2>

          <p>In this section, we would like to analyze if eastern culture and western culture users have different 
            community usage behavior on Twitter. In order to solve this problem, we focus on three 
            seperate questions.</p>

          <h3 class="section-subheading">Do both western and eastern culture follow the 80-20 rule?</h3>

          <p>The 80-20 rule originally referred to the observation that 80% of Italy’s wealth belonged to only 
            20% of the population. From the replication we did before, we have already known that Twitter users 
            follow the 80-20 rule. In this analysis, we seperate users into western and eastern groups and see 
            whether both the groups still follow the 80-20 rule, or at least a power law distribution in general.</p>
          
          <div class="box">
            <img src='static/img/tweets_per_user_distribution.jpg' width="100%" height="auto" id="figure_4">
          </div>

          <p>Parameter N means that only the users who have posted more than N tweets are included. The selection 
            of N does not influence the distribution qualitatively. The distribution of number of tweets per user 
            is quite similar for both. And the law of 80-20% is still plausible qualitatively. </p>

          <h3 class="section-subheading">Do western and eastern culture follow the circadian rhythm on twitter?</h3>
          
          <div class="box">
            <img src='static/img/active_time.jpg' width="100%" height="auto" id="figure_4">
          </div>

          <p>The plot for the eastern and western cultures look quite different. But they still seem to follow the 
            circadian rythm pattern as suggested in the paper.</p>
          <p>But an interesting thing to note is that a peak in the number of tweets is visible around 22h for both 
            west and east, but there is an equally high peak in the number of tweets around 13h in the east. Also, 
            the number of active users gradually increase after 4h for both west and east. But there is a drastic 
            dip in the number of active users between 15h and 21h in the east.</p>
          <p>Moreover, western users have a lower activity on weekend, while eastern users do not have this characteristic.</p>
          
          <h3 class="section-subheading">Do users in different languages have specific following preference?</h3>

          <p> In this section, we would like to know if users in different languages have a specific 'following' preference. 
            Therefore we sum up the following relationship network between users in different languages, and we can find out the 
            following pattern of different language users. Here, we only consider the following pairs in which egos are the 
            followers.</p>

          <div class="box">
            <img src='static/img/language_following/de.jpg' width="100%" height="auto" id="figure_5">
          </div>
        
          <p>From the figures, we learn that users always tend to follow users who use the same language as 
            themselves, just like we expected. However, we also find some other interesting facts:</p>
          
          <p>- All users in different languages have a high tendency to follow English accounts.</p>
          
          <p>- Western language users have higher interest in English language users than eastern languages users.</p>
          
          <p>- Portuguese and Spanish language users have a higher chance to follow each other compared to other languages.</p>
          
          <p>Next, we introduce another feature: internationality. The internationality coefficient is computed for each 
            ego, defined as the number of followers using a different language than the ego divided by the total number of followers.</p>

          <div class="box">
            <img src='static/img/internationality.jpg' width="100%" height="auto" id="figure_5">
          </div>

          <p>From the figure, we observe that German language users have the largest internationality coefficient which means 
            they have the highest interest to follow different languages accounts, instead of their own. On the other hand, 
            people speak Japanese have the smallest internationality coefficient, which means they are less likely to follow different 
            languages accounts, and instead, they choose to follow other Japanese users.

        <h3 class="section-subheading">Do different language users have different characteristic on 
          statistical results? ( i.e. activeness, popularity etc.)</h3>
        
        <p>From our results, we can clearly see that eastern culture have higher activeness and
          popularity on Twitter. Among all languages, Arabic language users have most friends and 
          most followers, while Korean language users have least friends and followers. Besides, 
          Japanese language users have highest average daily tweets, while German language users
          have lowest average daily tweets. Based on this alone, it can be concluded that Arabic culture 
	  is the most popular on Twitter, while Korean culture is the least popular. Moreover, Japanese users
          are the most active, while German users are the least active.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section-subheading">Do different culture (western and eastern) users have different 
          using behaviors on Twitter?</h3>
        
        <p><b>The 80-20 rule</b>: Both eastern and western culture follow the 80-20 rule</p>
        
        <p><b>Circadian Rhythm</b>: Both eastern and western culture follow the Circadian rhythm. However, 
          eastern users are more active during lunch and late night, while western users are the most active
	  around 8 p.m.

        <p><b>Following Preference</b>: People always like to follow accounts that use same language 
          with themselves. Moreover, all users from different languages have a high tendency to follow 
          English accounts.</p>

        <h3 class="section-subheading">Can we predict the culture of a user based on the features of 
          his/her own Twitter profile and that of the follower-followee network?
